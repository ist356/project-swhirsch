### What it does

My project is an analysis of passing statistics among all Quarterbacks in the 2023 NFL Season.


### How you run my project

My project is  organized with steps at the beginning at the beginning of the .py files under the code folder (1-9)/ For example, the first 3 steps are the data pipline, while the next 6 are apart of my analysis and generate graphs. Please run in order, espeically, the ETL steps (1-3). 

Full_Dashboard.py is my culimating streamlit analysis, complete with graphs and corresponding writing analyses. 

If there are any issues running my project, please email me at swhirsch@syr.edu or samwhirsch@gmail.com. It is very important to me that this is functional!

### Other things you need to know

If you have any questions, comments, or concerns, feel free to reach out at swhirsch@syr.edu or samwhirsch@gmail.com. I'm happy to discuss how this project could be improved. If I had more time on the project, I would analyze which variables have the strongest correlation to winning football games. For example, what is more important for a team's victory? A high number of Passing Touchdowns or a high Touchdown Percentage?
